                A project I'm proud to have worked on is my instant messaging API developed using Java and the springboot framework.
                This API allows users to organise travel opportunities with each other and uses reverse geocoding to take the location
                the proposing user has specified and return the weather conditions for that location as JSON using a series of external API's.
                This API was hosted on an Azure virtual machine to allow user's from across the globe to connect to my API. Finally, to show the
                interoperability of cloud-computing, two clients were made, one in Java using the Swing framework and another in Python using TKinter.

              <p class="mt-4">
                The task was simple, create an AI chatbot that utilises natural language processing to recongize what the user is
                attempting to ask and return the most appropriate answer. This was achieved using the Keras library and additional functionality was
                added such as the ability to extract the users name from their given input. Then came the image recognition this uses a
                locally trained an exported CNN along with Azure cognitive and custom vision services and a face recogntion service just to top it off.
                This entire chatbot was based around the BBC show Doctor Who. The AI could confirm or disprove statements given by the user,
                statements that could not be disproved were added to the knowledge base so the AI gained knowledge the more it was used. The AI was also
                capable of recognising the doctors within images and would classify images accordingly.

                Reducing run-time and maximising efficiency has always been something I've found fascinating. So much so that
                a significant part of my dissertation project has been spent discussing performance optimization and asymptotic notation.
                One of my projects in particular has included creating an optimal solution to the Royal Software Engineer's algorithm
                (an alteration of the three million men algorithm). This was doing by analysising the best, average and worst case complexities
                of standard library data structures and their methods to ultimately implement an optimal solution to the algorithm. Following this,
                the Royal Mathematicians Algorithm was attempted, this posed the same problem, only this time, space complexity was the priority and
                as such a new solution had to be devised.
