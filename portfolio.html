              I've worked on projects in a variety of different areas, from web development creating this wonderful
              website, to a chatbot that can answer questions and learn from it's interactions with users. Consider this

            <p class="mt-4" style="font-family:Verdana, arial; font-size:16px;">
              A project I'm proud to have worked on is my instant messaging API developed using Java and the springboot framework.
              This API allows users to organise travel opportunities with each other and uses reverse geocoding to take the location
              the proposing user has specified and return the weather conditions for that location as JSON using a series of external API's.
              This API was hosted on an Azure virtual machine to allow user's from across the globe to connect to my API. Finally, to show the
              interoperability of cloud-computing, two clients were made, one in Java using the Swing framework and another in Python using TKinter.

            <p class="mt-4" style="font-family:Verdana, arial; font-size:16px;">
              The task was simple, create an AI chatbot that utilises natural language processing to recongize what the user is
              attempting to ask and return the most appropriate answer. This was achieved using the Keras library and additional functionality was
              added such as the ability to extract the users name from their given input. Then came the image recognition this uses a
              locally trained an exported CNN along with Azure cognitive and custom vision services and a face recogntion service just to top it off.

            <p class="mt-4" style="font-family:Verdana, arial; font-size:16px;">
              Reducing run-time and maximising efficiency has always been something I've found fascinating. So much so that
              a significant part of my dissertation project has been spent discussing performance optimization and asymptotic notation.
              One of my projects in particular has included creating an optimal solution to the Royal Software Engineer's algorithm
              (an alteration of the three million men algorithm). This was doing by analysising the best, average and worst case complexities
              of standard library data structures and their methods to ultimately implement an optimal solution to the algorithm. Following this,
              the Royal Mathematicians Algorithm was attempted, this posed the same problem, only this time, space complexity was the priority and
              as such a new solution had to be devised.

              As part of my Systems Software module at NTU me and my group were tasked with the creation of a concurrent client-server model as
              a solution for a farmer who wants to keep track of their crops across multiple fields. This utlised a TCP/IP-based network infrastructure
              composed of the following components, all connected to the network:
