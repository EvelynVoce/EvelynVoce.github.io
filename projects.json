        "description": "A project I'm proud to have worked on is my instant messaging API developed using Java and the springboot framework. This API allows users to organise travel opportunities with each other and uses reverse geocoding to take the location the proposing user has specified and return the weather conditions for that location as JSON using a series of external API's. This API was hosted on an Azure virtual machine to allow user's from across the globe to connect to my API. Finally, to show the interoperability of cloud-computing, two clients were made, one in Java using the Swing framework and another in Python using TKinter.",

        "description": "The task was simple, create an AI chatbot that utilises natural language processing to recongize what the user is attempting to ask and return the most appropriate answer. This was achieved using the Keras library and additional functionality was added such as the ability to extract the users name from their given input. Then came the image recognition this uses a locally trained an exported CNN along with Azure cognitive and custom vision services and a face recogntion service just to top it off. This entire chatbot was based around the BBC show Doctor Who. The AI could confirm or disprove statements given by the user, statements that could not be disproved were added to the knowledge base so the AI gained knowledge the more it was used. The AI was also capable of recognising the doctors within images and would classify images accordingly.",
