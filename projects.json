        "description": "A project I'm proud to have worked on is my instant messaging API developed using Java and the springboot framework. This API allows users to organise travel opportunities with each other and uses reverse geocoding to take the location the proposing user has specified and return the weather conditions for that location as JSON using a series of external API's. This API was hosted on an Azure virtual machine to allow user's from across the globe to connect to my API. Finally, to show the interoperability of cloud-computing, two clients were made, one in Java using the Swing framework and another in Python using TKinter.",
