    "description": "I worked within a small team to create a website for the developerâ€™s society at NTU to allow them to display their events and allow members to register attendance. This application uses React for the front-end, C# for the back-end and an SQL database to store users accounts. This is a large-scale project designed to meet industry standards. It uses interfaces to allow for various internal implementations of methods to be switched out easily and each design layer is loosely coupled so layers can be edited freely without effecting code elsewhere.",
