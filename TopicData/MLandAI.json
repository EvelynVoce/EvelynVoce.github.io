    "description": "The task was simple, create an AI chatbot that utilises natural language processing to recognize what the user is attempting to ask and return the most appropriate answer. This was achieved using the Keras library and additional functionality was added such as the ability to extract the users name from their given input. Then came the image recognition this uses a locally trained and exported CNN, along with Azure cognitive and custom vision services and a face recognition service just to top it off. This entire chatbot was based around the BBC show Doctor Who. The AI could confirm or disprove statements given by the user; statements that could not be disproven were added to the knowledge base so that the AI could gain knowledge as it was used. The AI was also capable of recognising the doctors within images and would classify images accordingly.",

    "description": "A project I am very proud of is the use of machine learning to classify developers income based on multiple variables such as country, sex, ethnicity, job title, age, years of experience and much more. This project utilised multiple algorithms including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning. Ultimately I was able to classify a developers income with 88% accuracy.",
